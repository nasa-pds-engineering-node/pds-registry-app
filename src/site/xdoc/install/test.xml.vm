<subsection id="overview" name="Overview">
This document describes common tasks to do with the Registry, such as initializing your Registry, 
extracting metadata from PDS4 labels and loading it into the Registry, querying Elasticsearch,
and using Registry APIs.
</subsection>

<subsection id="harvest" name="Extract metadata from PDS4 labels">
<p>
To extract metadata from PDS4 labels (XML files) you have to use Harvest command-line tool.
Harvest parses PDS4 files and stores extracted metadata in a "newline delimited JSON" data file.
The JSON data file can be loaded into Elasticsearch by Registry Manager.
</p>

<p>
To run Harvest you need an XML configuration file. 
The configuration file has several sections which control which files the Harvest tool 
will crawl and what data to extract. Very basic configuration is shown below.
<source>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;harvest nodeName="PDS_ENG"&gt;
  &lt;directories&gt;
    &lt;path&gt;/data/LADEE/ldex_20161118"&lt;/path&gt;
  &lt;/directories&gt;
&lt;/harvest&gt;
</source>
</p>

<p>
You can process bundles or directories. There are few example configuration files in Harvest installation
directory, e.g., <i>harvest-$context.get("harvest.version")/conf/examples/directories.xml</i>.
Either edit one of the example files or use the minimal configuration shown above.
Note that you have to use a valid value of "nodeName" attribute.
</p>

<p>
Update the path with the location of your dataset. You can use a test dataset from <i>pds-registry-app</i> package
which you just installed.
More information about Harvest configuration is available in <a href="../operate/harvest.html">Harvest operation documentation</a>.
</p>
	    
<p>
To run Harvest, use <i>harvest</i> command on Unix or <i>harvest.bat</i> on Windows.
The following Unix example uses <i>config.xml</i> configuration file. 
The generated JSON data files will be saved in <i>~/tmp/data1</i> directory.
</p>

<source>
harvest -c /path/to/my/config.xml -o ~/tmp/data1
</source>

<p>
After running Harvest, the output folder (<i>~/tmp/data1</i>) will have several files:
<ul>
<li><i>registry-docs.json</i> - metadata extracted from PDS4 labels, stored in Newline-delimited JSON (NJSON) format.</li>
<li><i>refs-docs.json</i> - product references extracted from collection inventory files.</li>
<li><i>fields.txt</i> - a list of field names extracted from PDS4 labels.</li>
</ul>
</p>

</subsection>

<!-- =================================================================== -->
	
<subsection id="create" name="Create Registry">

<p>
You must create following registry indices in Elasticsearch, before loading data generated by Harvest tool.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>registry</b> - this index stores metadata extracted from PDS4 labels, one ES document per PDS label.</li>
<li><b>registry-dd</b> - this index stores data dictionary - a list of searchable fields and its data types.
When registry is created, the data dictionary is populated with fields (attributes) from PDS common and few discipline dictionaries.
You can add more fields as described in <a href="reg-custom.html#DD">Registry Customization / Data Dictionary</a> section.</li>
<li><b>registry-refs</b> - this index stores product references extracted from collection inventory files.
There could be 1 or more ES documents per inventory file.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To create registry indices in local Elasticsearch (running at <i>http://localhost:9200</i>) 
with 1 shard and 0 replicas, run the following Registry Manager command
</p>
<source>
registry-manager create-registry
</source>

<p>
You can customize <i>create-registry</i> command by passing several parameters, 
such as Elasticsearch URL, number of shards and replicas, authentication parameters.
To see the list of available parameters and basic usage run
<source>
registry-manager create-registry -help
</source>
</p>

<p>
To check that registry indices were created open the following URL in 
a browser: <i>http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v</i> or use <i>curl</i>.
</p>
<source>
curl "http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v"
</source>

<p>
The response should look similar to this. Make sure that index status is "green". 
</p>
<source>

</source>

<h4>Registry Data Dictionary</h4>

<p>
When a registry is created, the registry data dictionary is populated with fields (attributes) from 
PDS common and few discipline dictionaries. There are many data dictionaries at 
<a href="https://pds.nasa.gov/datastandards/dictionaries/" target="_blank">PDS website</a> but only
few of them are loaded into Registry by default.
</p>
<p>
You may need to load more data dictionaries as described in <a href="../operate/reg-custom.html">Registry Customization</a> section.
</p>

</subsection>

<!-- =================================================================== -->
	
<subsection id="load" name="Load harvested data into Registry (Elasticsearch)">

<p>
JSON files generated by Harvest, can be loaded into Elasticsearch by Registry Manager as shown below. 
</p>

<source>
registry-manager load-data -dir ~/tmp/data1/
</source>

<p>
Where <i>~/tmp/data1/</i> is the Harvest output directory with JSON files.
</p>

<p>
By default, Registry Manager will try updating Registry schema (add more fields)
from <i>fields.txt</i> file generated by Harvest in <i>~/tmp/data1/</i>.
</p>

<p>
If you try loading JSON data files with fields not defined in the Registry data dictionary,
you will get the following error:
</p>
<source>
[ERROR] Could not find datatype for field '...'
</source>

<p>
You have to update the registry data dictionary as described in <a href="reg-custom.html">Registry Customization</a> section
before you can load the data.
</p>

</subsection>

<!-- =================================================================== -->
	
<subsection id="query" name="Query Elasticsearch">

<p>
You can query Registry indices in Elasticsearch by calling
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/search-search.html" target="_blank">Elasticsearch Search API</a>.
</p>



<p>
You can either use simple Lucene queries, passed in the URL:
</p>
<source>
# Select all products
curl "http://localhost:9200/registry/_search?q=*&amp;pretty"

# Select only collections
curl "http://localhost:9200/registry/_search?q=product_class:Product_Collection&amp;pretty"
</source>

<p>
Or more advanced Elasticsearch queries defined in JSON and passed in the request body:
</p>

<source>
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/registry/_search?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "product_class": "Product_Collection"
    }
  }
}
'
</source>

</subsection>

<!-- =================================================================== -->

<subsection id="api" name="Use Registry API">
<h4>Swagger UI</h4>

<p>
Open <i>http://localhost:8080</i> URL in a web browser.
You should see a page similar to this.
</p>

<img src="../images/swagger-ui.png" style="width:50em;" />

<p>
Select an API you want to call, for example <i>collections</i>
</p>

<img src="../images/swagger2.png" style="width:60em;" />

<p>
Select response content type "application/json" from a dropdown and click "Try it out!" button.
You should see JSON response in "Response Body" section of the screen. 
You might need to scroll down to see the results.
</p>

<h4>Curl</h4>

<p>
You can also use <i>curl</i> to call Registry API. For example,
</p>

<source>
curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://localhost:8000/collections?limit=10'
</source>
